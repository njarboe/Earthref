# Earthref
The repository is currently used for issue tracking all the sites at earthref.org except MagIC.

As we switch over parts of earthref.org to the new web framework and data store, we will add seperate repositories for those sub-units. ERDA, GERM, SBN, ERESE. We are not putting the old code here, but are using GitHub as an issue tracker for the rest earthref.org.
